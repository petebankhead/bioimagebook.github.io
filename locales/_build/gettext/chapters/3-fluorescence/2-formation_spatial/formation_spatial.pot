msgid "Microscopy images normally look blurry because light originating from one point in the sample is not all detected at a single pixel: usually it is detected over several pixels and _z_-slices. This is _not_ simply because we cannot use perfect lenses; rather, it's caused by a fundamental limit imposed by the nature of light. The end result is as if the light that we detect is redistributed slightly throughout our data ({numref}`fig-castles`)."

Think of the sand as photons, and the [height of the sandcastle as the intensity values of pixels](fig-transform_surface) (a greater height indicates more photons, and thus a brighter pixel). The ideal data would be sharp and could contain fine details (A), but after blurring it's not only harder to discriminate details, but intensities in the brighter regions have been reduced and sizes increased (B). If we then wish to determine the size or height of one of the sandcastle's towers, for example, we need to remember that any results we get by measuring (B) will differ from those we would have got if we could have measured (A) itself. Note, however, that approximately the same _amount_ of signal (sand or photons) is present in both cases â€“- only the arrangement has been changed."

msgid "That's the bad news about blur. The good news is that it's rather well understood, and we can take some comfort that it is not random. In fact, the main ideas have already been described in {ref}`chap_filters`, because blurring in fluorescence microscopy is mathematically described by a **convolution** involving the microscope's **Point Spread Function (PSF)**. In other words, the PSF acts like a linear filter applied to the perfect, sharp data we would like but can never directly acquire."

msgid "Previously, we saw how smoothing (e.g. mean or Gaussian) filters could helpfully reduce noise, but as the filter size increased we would [lose more and more detail](chap_filters_gaussian_size). At that time, we could choose the size and shapes of filters ourselves, changing them arbitrarily by modifying coefficients to get the noise-reduction vs. lost-detail balance we liked best. But the microscope's blurring differs in at least two important ways. Firstly, it's effectively applied to our data _before_ noise gets involved, so offers no noise-reduction benefits. Secondly, because it occurs before we ever set our eyes on our images, the size and shape of the filter used (i.e. the PSF) are only indirectly (and in a very limited way) under our control. It would therefore be much nicer just to dispense with the blurring completely since it offers no real help, but unfortunately light conspires to make this not an option: we just need to cope with it."

Rather, it ends up being focused to some larger volume known as the PSF, which has a minimum size dependent upon both the light's wavelength and the lens being used."

msgid "Although it might not be obvious at low magnification (A), an image can be viewed as composed of small points (B). This gives us a useful way to understand what has happened in a blurred image: each point has simply been replaced by a more diffuse blob, the PSF. Images appear more or less blurred depending upon how large the blobby PSFs are \\(C) and (D). This is equivalent to applying the PSF to an image as a linear filter."

msgid "This becomes more practically relevant if we consider that _any_ fluorescing sample can be viewed as composed of many similar, exceedingly small light-emitting points -- you may think of each point being a fluorophore. Our image would ideally then include individual points too, digitized into pixels with values proportional to the emitted light. But what we get instead is an image in which every point has been replaced by its PSF, scaled according to the point's brightness. Where these PSFs overlap, the detected light intensities are simply added together. Exactly how blurry this causes the image to be depends upon the size of the PSF ({numref}`fig-psf_sizes`)."

But the light itself is oblivious to our wishes, and will cheerfully be detected if it happens to strike a detector, no matter where that is. Therefore we should expect the light to be detected across a small region only if the image is in-focus; otherwise it will be spread out to an extent that depends upon how far from the focal point it is detected.

These factors relate to the interference of light waves. While it's important to know that the rings occur -- if only to avoid ever misinterpreting them as extra ring-like structures being really present in a sample -- they have limited influence upon any analysis because the central region of the PSF is overwhelmingly brighter.

msgid "$a$ is simply a background constant, $b$ tells you the peak amplitude (i.e. the maximum value of the Gaussian with the background subtracted), and $c$ gives the location of the peak along the profile line. But potentially the most useful parameter here is $d$, which corresponds to the $\\sigma$ value of a Gaussian filter. So if you know this value for a PSF, you can approximate the same amount of blurring with a Gaussian filter. This may come in useful in {ref}`chap_macro_simulating`."

msgid "Note that this is the _limit_ of the Airy disk size, and assumes that the system is free of any aberrations. In other words, this is the best that we can hope for: the Airy disk cannot be made smaller simply by better focusing, although it could easily be made worse by a less-than-perfect objective lens"
