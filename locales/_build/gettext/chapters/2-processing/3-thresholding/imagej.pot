To complicate matters, ImageJ also permits _either_ of these to represent the foreground, with the choice hidden away under {menuselection}`Process --> Binary --> Options...`, and 0 taken to be 'black' and 255 'white'. Personally, I prefer for white to represent the foreground (i.e. the interesting things we have detected), and so I will assume that the {guilabel}`Black background` option has been checked."
