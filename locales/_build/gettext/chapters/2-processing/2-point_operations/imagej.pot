#: ../../../chapters/2-processing/2-point_operations/imagej.md:54
msgid "When it comes to image processing, undo effectively requires the software to quietly duplicate the pixel values of an image before any processing step, so that they can be recovered later if needed. For a small image, that can work fine. But for big images (say, 1 GB or more), duplicating that much data could *significantly* slow down the software and potentially result in lots of out-of-memory errors."
