msgid "The simplest operations are **point operations**, which act on individual pixels. Point operations change each pixel in a way that depends upon its own value, but not upon where it is in the image nor upon the values of other pixels. This is in contrast to **neighborhood operations**, which calculate new pixel values based upon the values of pixels nearby."

msgid "If you add a constant that pushes pixel values outside the range supported by the bit-depth (e.g. 0â€“255 for 8-bit), then the result cannot fit in the image. It's likely to be clipped to the closest possible value instead. Subtracting the constant again does not restore the original value."

msgstr ""

#: ../../../chapters/2-processing/2-point_operations/point_operations.md:188
msgid "Inverting an 8-bit (unsigned integer) image generally means subtracting all pixel values from 255, because 255 is the maximum supported by the image type and bit-depth."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../chapters/2-processing/2-point_operations/point_operations.md:190
msgid "The 'maximum' is not always defined in this way. For a 32-bit or 64-bit image (either integer or floating point), the maximum possible value is *huge*, and using that would result in exceedingly large pixel values. Therefore the 'maximum' is usually defined in some other way rather than based on the image type, such as by taking the maximum pixel value found within the image."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../chapters/2-processing/2-point_operations/point_operations.md:194
msgid "Because I don't like letting the software decide what maximum to use, I often cheat: I multiply the pixels by -1 (ensuring the image is floating point).

msgid "With arithmetic operations we change the pixel values, usefully or otherwise, but (assuming we have not clipped our image in the process) we have done so in a **linear** way. At most it would take another multiplication and/or addition to get us back to where we were. Because a similar relationship between pixel values exists, we could also adjust the brightness and contrast LUT so that it does not *look* like we have done anything at all."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../chapters/2-processing/2-point_operations/point_operations.md:206
msgid "**Nonlinear** point operations differ in that they affect relative values differently depending upon what they were in the first place. These are particularly useful for contrast enhancement."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../chapters/2-processing/2-point_operations/point_operations.md:209
msgid "When we changed the brightness and contrast in {ref}`sec_images_luts`, we were making linear adjustments. For a grayscale LUT, this meant we chose the pixel value to display as black and the pixel value to display as white, with each value in between mapped to a shade of gray along a straight line ({numref}`fig-nonlinear_contrast`A)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../chapters/2-processing/2-point_operations/point_operations.md:212
msgid "We could optionally use a nonlinear mapping values between values and shades of gray, but most software doesn't make it straightforward to change LUTs in sufficiently complicated ways. An easier approach is to duplicate the image and apply any non-linear adjustments to the pixel values themselves, and then map them to shades of gray in the usual (linear) way."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../chapters/2-processing/2-point_operations/point_operations.md:215
msgid "Common nonlinear transforms are to take the logarithm of the pixel value ({numref}`fig-nonlinear_contrast`B), or replace each value $p$ with $p^\\gamma$ where $\\gamma$ is the *gamma* parameter that can be adjusted depending upon the desired outcome ({numref}`fig-nonlinear_contrast`B-D)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../chapters/2-processing/2-point_operations/point_operations.md:270
msgid "Nonlinear transforms applied to a simple 'ramp' image, consisting of linearly increasing pixel values. Replacing each pixel with its log or gamma-adjusted value has the effect of compressing either the lower or higher intensities closer together to free up more gray levels for the others. Note that, here we assume an 8-bit input image and have incorporated some necessary rescaling for an 8-bit output (based on the approach used by ImageJ)."

msgid "{numref}`fig-point_gamma_spooked` shows this in action. Here, the pixel values associated with the main character are all quite high.
