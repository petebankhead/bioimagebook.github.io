Anything that can be created with the blocks can also be made from the Lego; anything made from the Lego can also be made from the clay. This does not work in reverse: some complex creations can only be represented properly by clay, and building blocks permit only a crude approximation at best. On the other hand, if you only need something blocky, it’s not really worth the extra effort of Lego or clay. And, from a very great distance, it might be hard to tell the difference."
