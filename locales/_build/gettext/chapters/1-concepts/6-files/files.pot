msgid "**Website: JPEG or PNG**, <br />JPEG (usually) because smaller file sizes mean the website can load quicker (and eat less data). But PNG for images that contain few colors, including most 'artificial' images such as drawings, dialog boxes or logos. JPEG artifacts can look especially ugly in such cases, while PNG can compress them very well."

#: ../../../chapters/1-concepts/6-files/files.md:479
msgid "**Vector images**. These are composed of lines, curves, shapes or text.  The instructions needed to draw the image (i.e. coordinates, equations, fonts) are stored rather than pixels, and then the image is recreated from these instructions when necessary."

msgid "If you scale a 2D bitmap image by doubling its width and height, then it will contain four times as many pixels. Guesses need to be made about how to fill in the extra information properly (which is the problem of **interpolation**), and the result generally looks less sharp than the original. But if you double the size of a vector image, it's just a matter of updating the maths needed to draw the image accordingly, and the result looks just as sharp as the original."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../chapters/1-concepts/6-files/files.md:488
msgid "Vector images are therefore best for things like diagrams, histograms, plots and charts, because they can be resized freely and still look good. Also, they often have tiny file sizes because only a few instructions to redraw the image need to be kept, whereas a huge number of pixels might be required to store sufficiently nice, sharp text in a bitmap. But bitmaps are needed for images formed from detecting light, which cannot be reduced to a few simple equations and instructions."

#: ../../../chapters/1-concepts/6-files/files.md:492
msgid "Finally, some versatile file formats, such as PDF or EPS, can store both kinds of image: perhaps a bitmap with some text annotations on top. If you are including text or diagrams, these formats are generally best. But if you only have bitmaps without annotations of any kind, then TIFF is probably the most common file format for creating figures."
