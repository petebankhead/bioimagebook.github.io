But perhaps they were not originally so, and separate channels have been merged into the same ones. If you had started with more than three channels, this will definitely have occurred, but even if you had fewer channels you can have problems (like in the *Neuron_composite.tif* and *Neuron_RGB.tif* examples)."

msgid "The trouble with _only_ having an RGB image is that it is no longer possible to know for sure what the original data looked like, to be able to figure out whether anything has been lost. For example, perhaps you have managed to generate a magnificent image consisting of turquoise, yellow and dazzling pink channels. Each pixel is displayed on screen as a combination of those colors. However, precisely the same color for any pixel can also be represented -- rather more simply -- as a mixture of red, green and blue. So no matter what channels and colors you began with, the final result after merging can be replicated using red, green and blue channels. But if you _only_ have the RGB version, you might never be able to extract the original 3 channels again. Their colors could be so mixed together that the original pixel values would be irretrievably lost."
