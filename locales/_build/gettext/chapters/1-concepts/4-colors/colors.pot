msgid "In general, each color is represented using three 8-bit unsigned integers: one for **r**ed, one for **g**reen, one for **b**lue. Each integer value defines how much of each primary color should be mixed together to create the final color used to display the pixel."

msgid "{numref}`fig-colors_im_grays_rgb` shows this in action. In the 'least destructive' case, the image has a grayscale LUT.

We can separate out the red, green and blue values from the RGB image and visualize each as separate images to explore the information they contain. Even though the RGB image looks unchanged from the original, and all three color channels have similar histograms to the original, the bit-depth has been reduced and image statistics modified.

msgid "The explanation is almost invariably that their images were really 16-bit or 32-bit, but they tried to open them in software that doesn't handle 16-bit images very well (e.g. they just double-clicked the file to open it in the default image viewer). All they saw as a black, seemingly-empty image."

msgstr ""

#: ../../../chapters/1-concepts/4-colors/colors.md:352

msgid "Crucially, the analysis of brightfield images in histology usually aims to replicate (and sometimes improve upon) the visual assessment that a pathologist might make looking down a microscope. It's often based on detecting, classifying and counting cells, measuring stained areas, or recognizing the presence of particular patterns -- but *not* accurately quantifying staining intensity."

msgstr ""

#: ../../../chapters/1-concepts/4-colors/colors.md:386
msgid "Such images can be converted to 8-bit RGB using a LUT. If we do this, then we get an image with **three channels**, where each channel is displayed using red, green and blue LUTs -- with the colors blended together for display. But we shouldn't do that conversion prior to analysis in case we lose our raw data."
msgstr ""

msgstr ""

#: ../../../chapters/1-concepts/4-colors/colors.md:393
msgid "In fluorescence microscopy, it's common to acquire multichannel images in which pixel values for each channel are determined from light that has been filtered according to its wavelength. We *might* choose to visualize these channels as red, green and blue, but we don't have to."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../chapters/1-concepts/4-colors/colors.md:396
msgid "In principle, any LUT might be applied to each channel, but it makes sense to choose LUTs that somehow relate to the wavelength (i.e. color) of light detected for the corresponding channels. Channels can then be overlaid on top of one another, and their colors further merged for display (e.g. high values in both green and red channels are shown as yellow)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../chapters/1-concepts/4-colors/colors.md:399
msgid "The important feature of these images is that the actual channel information is always retained, and so the original pixel values remain available. This means we can still extract channels or adjust their LUTs as needed."

msgstr ""

#: ../../../chapters/1-concepts/4-colors/colors.md:455
msgid "Then, again just like with the single channel image, this is problematic if we don't keep the raw data -- because we can never recover the original values from the RGB representation."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../chapters/1-concepts/4-colors/colors.md:462
msgid "We can create an RGB image from {numref}`fig-colors_composite_non_rgb`, but then we have three channels locked to red, green and blue -- which have converted the original channels to 8-bit, and mixed up information due to the LUT colors used. We can no longer recover the original pixel values after converting to RGB."

msgid "RGB images aren't *bad* -- we almost always need them for display, and for *some* imaging applications (e.g. brightfield histology) they are the best raw data we can get. But we need to be cautious if our raw data isn't RGB, and avoid converting to RGB too early."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../chapters/1-concepts/4-colors/colors.md:481
msgid "In the end, it's normal to keep at least two versions of each dataset: one in the original (possibly multichannel) format, and one as RGB for display. This RGB image is normally created as the _final_ step, after applying any processing or LUT adjustments to the original data."

msgstr ""

#: ../../../chapters/1-concepts/4-colors/colors.md:491
msgid "For example, we could convert an RGB image to an *HSB* representation, where HSB stands for *Hue*, *Saturation* and *Brightness*. This is useful to separate hue from brightness, e.g. to help identify all red pixels regardless of whether they are bright or dark."
