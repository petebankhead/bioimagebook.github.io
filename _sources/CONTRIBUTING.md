# Contributing

This is intended to be an open handbook that I really hope is useful to the scientific community.

If you'd like to contribute, please see below for more info.

## Ideas & discussions

If you'd just like to chat about anything in this book (e.g. because it's unclear, or you have a better way to explain the concept), then please create a post on the **Scientific Community Image Forum** at https://forum.image.sc/tag/bioimage-book using the tag *bioimage-book*

## Corrections

If you find something that's definitely an error, feel free to create an issue on GitHub that describes what is wrong.

However, I'd rather **only** use GitHub for errors: that way, it will act as my todo list of bugs and mistakes to fix.
For **all other discussions, please use image.sc** as described above.

## Example images

I reuse the same images a lot... perhaps too much.
I'd be very happy to incorporate new images in future versions.

If you have original microscopy images that you think could fit, and you're willing to share them, please create a post on image.sc to let me know.

It's important that any such images are shared under a permissive open license -- preferably [CC0/Public domain](https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/public-domain/cc0/), to ensure they are as easy for others to reuse as possible.
I will very happily acknowledge the creator of the image in the book.

## New chapters & other content

Because this is a personal project, I'm afraid that I don't *really* want contributions that add or change the content substantially.

At the risk of seeming like a bad member of the 'open science' community, I'd prefer work on the main content myself for three main reasons:

   1. I write it for the satisfaction of creating something and to teach myself new things, as a hobby in my diminishing spare time. Becoming an editor for others sounds like a lot of work, which risks sucking the fun out of it for me.
   2. I've tried to make this writing informal and have one clear - sometimes opinionated - voice.
   3. I only can be ruthless with making changes and improvements for my own words; if I start incorporating things other people have written, I'd feel bad about changing them too much. I'd like to keep the freedom to make updates without offending anyone.
          
So if you want to contribute any major change, please don't be annoyed if I don't accept the contribution into the main project.
Of course, you're free to do whatever the license permits in terms of reusing bits of the material here along with your own material.

Certainly there are topics that are missing.
I already have tentative plans to add new sections on machine learning, but it might take me a while to get around to it.
