This includes all text and drawings, unless otherwise noted.

My aim is to make the content easy to reuse.
Content from others is used sparingly to keep things simple.

The main exception is that I'm not a microscopist, so the original microscopy images are always from others.
Please check the [acknowledgements](acknowledgements/acknowledgements) for more specific information.

If you want to recreate similar figures using your *own* microscopy images, you can use [the code in the book](sec-live-notebooks) to do that.

And if you find any attribution is missing or incorrect, please [create a PR or open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/bioimagebook/bioimagebook.github.io) so it can be fixed.
