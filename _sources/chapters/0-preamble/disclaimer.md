Bioimage analysis is often misunderstood.
Including by me.

This book attempts to demystify the parts of it that I (think I) understand.
But although I've tried to ensure that everything here is accurate at the time of writing, please keep in mind the possibility of errors and treat the content with suitable caution.

Or to put it in the kind of words seen in open licenses: *this text is made available as-is and without warranties of any kind*.

If you do find a mistake, please let me know on [image.sc](https://forum.image.sc/tags/bioimage-book) so that I can fix it.
