## Introduction

Most of the filters we've considered are available through the {menuselection}`Process --> Filters` submenu.
This section adds a little more information about their implementation in ImageJ, and asks a few questions.

## Linear filters

### Mean filters

The easiest way to apply a 3×3 mean filter in ImageJ is through the {menuselection}`Process --> Smooth` command.
The fact that the shortcut is {kbd}`Shift+S` can almost make this *too* easy, as I find myself accidentally smoothing when I really wanted to save my image.
Take care.

To apply larger mean filters, the command is {menuselection}`Process --> Filters --> Mean...`.
It uses approximately circular neighborhoods, and the neighborhood size is adjusted by choosing a {guilabel}`Radius` value.
The {menuselection}`Process --> Filters --> Show Circular Masks` command displays the neighborhoods used for different values of {guilabel}`Radius`.
If you happen to choose *Radius = 1*, you get a 3×3 filter -- and the same results as using {menuselection}`Smooth`.

```


### Gaussian filters

{menuselection}`Process --> Filters --> Gaussian Blur...` is the command that implements a Gaussian filter.

In the event that you want a Gaussian filter that isn't isotropic (i.e. has a different size along different dimensions), {menuselection}`Process --> Filters --> Gaussian Blur 3D...` can be used.

Although not *really* recommended, unsharp masking is available through {menuselection}`Process --> Filters --> Unsharp mask...`.

:::{admonition} Difference of Gaussians
There's currently no direct command in ImageJ to implement difference of Gaussians filtering, rather the steps need to be pieced together with image duplication and subtraction.
However {ref}`chap_macro_dog` describes how to generate a macro for DoG filtering.
:::

### Custom linear filters

{menuselection}`Process --> Filters --> Convolve...` makes it possible to define any custom linear filter by entering the values of the desired coefficients, separated by spaces and arranged in rows and columns.
If you {guilabel}`Normalize Kernel` is selected, then the coefficients are scaled so that they add to 1, by dividing by the sum of all the coefficients -- unless the sum is 0, in which case requesting normalizion does nothing.

```{tab-item} Question


When defining an _n_×_n_ filter kernel with {menuselection}`Convolve...`, ImageJ insists that __n__ is an odd number. Why?
```


```{tab-item} Answer

If *n* is an odd number, the filter has a clear central pixel.
This makes it possible to center the filter kernel on a pixel on the image.

```{tab-item} Question


Predict what happens when you convolve an image using a filter that consists of a single coefficient with a value -1 in the following cases:

1.  {guilabel}`Normalize Kernel` is checked
2.  You have a 32-bit image, {guilabel}`Normalize Kernel` is unchecked
3.  You have an 8-bit image, {guilabel}`Normalize Kernel` is unchecked
```

```{tab-item} Answer

The results of convolving with a single -1 coefficient in different circumstances:
1.  _{guilabel}`Normalize Kernel` is checked_: Nothing at all happens. The normalization makes the filter just a single 1... and convolving with a single 1 leaves the image unchanged.
2.  _You have a 32-bit image ({guilabel}`Normalize Kernel` unchecked)_: The pixel values become negative, and the image looks inverted.
3.  _You have an 8-bit image ({guilabel}`Normalize Kernel` unchecked)_: The pixel values would become negative, but then cannot be stored in an 8-bit unsigned integer form. Therefore, all pixels simply become clipped to zero.
```

````{tab-item} Practical


Using any image, work out which of the methods for dealing with boundaries shown in {numref}`fig-filter_boundaries` is used by ImageJ's {menuselection}`Convolve...` command.

**Note:** This requires a bit of creativity.
It will certainly help to use an image with some variation at the image boundary.
I used {menuselection}`File --> Open Samples --> Blobs`.

````{tab-item} Solution

Replication of boundary pixels is the default method used by {menuselection}`Process --> Filters --> Convolve...` in ImageJ (although other filtering plugins by different authors might use different methods).

My approach to test this involved using {menuselection}`Convolve...` with a filter that consisting of a 1 followed by a lot of zeros (e.g. `1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0...`).
This basically shifts the image to the right, bringing whatever is outside the image boundary into view.

Gradient magnitude
```

`````{tab-set}

```{tab-item} Practical


Practice using the commands we've met so far by determining the **gradient magnitude** of an image, as described [here](sec_filters_gradient).

You will need to use
* {menuselection}`Image --> Duplicate...`
* {menuselection}`Process --> Filters --> Convolve...`
* {menuselection}`Process --> Image Calculator...`
* Several commands in the {menuselection}`Process --> Math` submenu
* Something else we've used before... possibly

If you need a sample image, you can use {menuselection}`File --> Open samples --> Blobs (25K)`.
_(Be sure to pay attention to the bit-depth!)_

[![launch ImageJ.JS](https://ij.imjoy.io/assets/badge/launch-imagej-js-badge.svg)](https://ij.imjoy.io?run=https://gist.github.com/petebankhead/cbbb6f210d173c8488247799efc3b970)
```

````{tab-item} Solution
The process to calculate the gradient magnitude is:

1.  Convert the image to 32-bit (if it isn't already 32-bit)
2.  Duplicate the image
3.  Convolve one copy of the image with the horizontal gradient filter, and one with the vertical (i.e. coefficients `-1 0 1` arranged as a row or column)
4.  Compute the square of both images ({menuselection}`Process --> Math --> Square`)
5.  Use the image calculator to add the images together
6.  Compute the square root of the resulting image ({menuselection}`Process --> Math --> Square Root`)

Here's a macro that implements these steps:
```java
run("32-bit");

id1 = getImageID()
run("Duplicate...", " ");
id2 = getImageID();

run("Convolve...", "text1=[-1 0 1\n] normalize");
run("Square");

selectImage(id1);
run("Convolve...", "text1=-1\n0\n1\n normalize");
run("Square");

imageCalculator("Add create", id1, id2);
run("Square Root");
```

The convolution results in negative values, which is why the 32-bit conversion is needed.

**Note:** This is (almost) what is done by the command {menuselection}`Process --> Find Edges`, except the gradient filters are slightly different.

The 'Edges' LUT
```

````{tab-set}

```{tab-item} Practical


ImageJ has a LUT called **edges** under {menuselection}`Image --> Lookup Tables --> Edges`.
Applied to {menuselection}`File --> Open samples --> Blobs (25K)`, it does a rather good job of highlighting edges -- without actually changing the pixels at all.

How does it work?
Does it apply a filter?

[![launch ImageJ.JS](https://ij.imjoy.io/assets/badge/launch-imagej-js-badge.svg)](https://ij.imjoy.io?run=https://gist.github.com/petebankhead/cbbb6f210d173c8488247799efc3b970)
```


```{tab-item} Solution
The {menuselection}`edges` LUT shows most low and high pixel values as black -- and uses lighter shades of gray only for a small range of values in between (see {menuselection}`Image --> Color --> Edit LUT...`).
In any image with a good separation of background and foreground pixels, but which still has a somewhat smooth transition between them, this means everything but the edges can appear black.

All this is achieved by a LUT: no pixels were harmed, there was no filtering applied.
```

## Nonlinear filters

### Rank filters

The main rank filters are to be found exactly where you might expect them:

* {menuselection}`Process --> Filters --> Median...`
* {menuselection}`Process --> Filters --> Minimum...`
* {menuselection}`Process --> Filters --> Maximum...`

ImageJ uses circular neighborhoods with its built-in rank filters, similar to how mean filters are implemented.
We will meet these filters again in {ref}`chap_morph`.


### Removing outliers

{numref}`fig-processing_filters_speckled` shows that median filtering is much better than mean filtering for removing outliers.
We might encounter this if something in the microscope is not quite functioning as expected or if dark noise is a problem, but otherwise we expect the noise in fluorescence microscopy images to produce few really extreme values (see {ref}`chap_formation_noise`).

Nevertheless, {menuselection}`Process --> Noise --> Remove Outliers...` provides an alternative if isolated bright values are present.
This is a nonlinear filter that inserts median values _only whenever a pixel is found that is further away from the local median than some adjustable threshold_.

It's therefore like a more selective median filter that will only modify the image at pixels where it is considered really necessary.
