    "## What is ImageJ?\n",
    "\n",
    "**ImageJ** is open-source software for image analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Created by **Wayne Rasband** at the National Institutes of Health, ImageJ has become indispensable to the research community over more than 20 years.\n",
    "It continues to be updated regularly and is by far the most discussed topic on the [Scientific Community Image Forum](https://forum.image.sc) -- with [more than 10,000 topics](https://forum.image.sc/tags) at the time of writing, and more added every day.\n",
    "\n",
    "ImageJ's success is due not only to the features of the software itself, but to its openness and extensibility.\n",
    "The source code is in the public domain, meaning that others can adapt it as needed.\n",
    "But usually this isn't necessary, because users can write (and share) custom macros, plugins or scripts to add new functionality -- without changing ImageJ itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "I personally have found ImageJ phenomenally useful throughout my career, to the extent that I am convinced that *anyone* working with biomedical images benefits if they know how to use it.\n",
    "Even if you ultimately use other software for your analysis, or even write your own, the ability to quickly check things in ImageJ is extremely helpful.\n",
    "\n",
    "These sections are intended to help any interested reader develop a strong working knowledge of ImageJ itself, while simultaneously gaining a deeper understanding of image analysis in general."

    "### Getting ImageJ\n",
    "\n",
    "ImageJ is available in multiple forms.\n",
    "Three of the most important ones for our purposes are:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. ImageJ\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"../../../images/logos/imagej-logo.png\" align=\"right\" width=10% />\n",
    "\n",
    "**Download from https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/**\n",
    "\n",
    "The 'original' download of ImageJ contains all the core functionality, but no extra user plugins.\n",
    "\n",
    "The core of the application is a tiny file *ij.jar* (~2.5 MB) that runs on Java.\n",
    "You can download a platform-specific package that includes both ImageJ and Java for Windows, Mac or Linux.\n",
    "Including Java makes the download bigger, but makes the application self-contained and easy to run.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Fiji\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"../../../images/logos/fiji-logo.png\" align=\"right\" width=10% />\n",
    "\n",
    "**Download from https://fiji.sc/**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Fiji**, which stands for _**F**iji **I**s **J**ust **I**mageJ_, is a distribution of ImageJ that comes bundled with a plethora of plugins and extra features that are especially useful for life scientists.\n",
    "It also has a powerful script editor that helps a lot when developing macros or scripts, an updater to help manage all the additions, and even a ['Big Data Viewer'](https://imagej.net/plugins/bdv/) for particularly huge images.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. ImageJ.JS\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"../../../images/logos/imagej.js-logo.png\" align=\"right\" width=10% />\n",
    "\n",
    "**Run at https://ij.imjoy.io**\n",
    "\n",
    "ImageJ.JS is a web version of the original ImageJ, capable of running in a browser.\n",
    "It has a few extra features, but not as many as Fiji.\n",
    "It was put together and is maintained by the [ImJoy team](https://github.com/imjoy-team) led by Wei Ouyang.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more information, see https://imagej.net/software/imagej-js\n",

    "it can be used to launch ImageJ.JS directly from this book, often with a relevant image opened.\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, ImageJ.JS will open in the same browser tab.\n",
    "If you want it to open in a new tab, then there's probably an easy trick in your browser to do that (on a computer, my guess is that it'll be pressing {kbd}`Ctrl` or {kbd}`⌘` when clicking the link).\n",

    "ImageJ.JS doesn't require any installation: just a modern web browser.\n",
    "\n",
    "Everything ImageJ can do can also be accomplished in Fiji (because Fiji contains the full ImageJ inside it), but the converse is not true (because Fiji contains many extra bits)\n",
    "Therefore Fiji is my first choice for more extensive analysis tasks.\n",
    "Its main disadvantage is that it's a lot bigger: taking longer to start up and run update checks, and containing a lot of commands that I don't always need.\n",
    "\n",
    "By contrast, the original ImageJ is very small and lightweight.\n",
    "On my computer, it starts almost instantly.\n",
    "It remains my first choice for quick, common tasks with images.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Most* ImageJ-related practicals in this course only use core features, and so can be done using any of ImageJ, Fiji or ImageJ.JS.\n",
    "Sometimes in this book I will refer to explicitly to Fiji, indicating that the relevant command is *only* available in Fiji.\n",
    "\n",
    ":::\n",
    "\n",
    ":::{admonition} Remember to cite the software you use!\n",
    ":class: important\n",
    "\n",
    "A lot of open-source software is developed and supported by academics, who invest a huge amount of time into development and support.\n",
    "They need funding to continue that work[^fn_1], and paper citations to help get that funding.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you use software for research you plan to publish, please spend a few minutes searching for how the developers of the software want it to be cited.\n",
    "\n",
    "* For ImageJ & Fiji, see https://imagej.net/contribute/citing\n",

    "### The ImageJ Interface\n",
    "\n",
